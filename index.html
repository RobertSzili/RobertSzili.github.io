This is the status page for a currently<br>
nameless software solution's development<br>
 process.<br>
It is currently under development but I'll try to<br>
post as many info about as possible. This<br>
includes
task lists, test result history, code metrics, etc.<br>

</p>
<p>
The software's future goals:
<list>
<li>Solve geometric boundary value problems</li>
<li>GR simulations using ADM formalism</li>
<li>Graphical ouput to visualize spacetimes</li>
<li>Symbolic processes to optimize the <br>
computational code</li>
</list>
</p>
<p>
Milestone(s) reached
<list>
<li>2022.03.27 First geometric PDE containing Ricci <br>
 tensor solved</li>
</list>
</p>
<p>
Next goal(s)
<list>
<li>Approximate well known spacetime metrics <br>
as boundary value problems</li>
<li>Implement ADM constraint and evolution<br>
equations</li>
</list>
</p>
Developed by Robert Szili in 2021-2022.<br>
Source code and development documents are<br>
under a closed licence, but in case of interest<br>
